                    Adding fractions can be tricy to understand sometimes but it is also important to understand
                    becuause you may face many situation in math where you have to perform addition of fraction
                    but there is also a simple method to add fraction. Lets consider this fraction
                </p>
                <div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-left: 50px;">
                    <img src="image1.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                Now we have two terms in it 4 divided by 9 and 7 divided by 3. We will found the common demoneter of thses terms.
                For this, first we will write the multiples of the first denominater 9 which are
            </p>
                <p>
                    9, 18, 27, 36, 45,......
                </p>
                <p>
                    and now the multilples of the second denominater 3 which are 
                </p>
                <p>
                    3, 6, 9, 12,......
                </p>
                <p>
                    we can see we have 9 in the multiples of first term and we have 9 also in the multiples of second terms. It
                    means we have a common denominater which is 9. So we will put 9 in demoniter of the resultant term.
                </p>
                <div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-left: 50px;">
                    <img src="image2.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now will divide this 9 with the denominater of first term which is also 9 so the 9/9=1. Now we will multiply this 1 with the 
                    numerater of this first term which is 4. So 4*1=4 so will put this 4 in place of first term of the resultant term.
                </p>
                <div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-left: 50px;">
                    <img src="image3.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now we do this again with the second term. We will divide this 9 with the denominater of second term which is 3 so 9/3=3. Now 
                    will multiply this 3 with the numerater of second term which is 7 so 3*7=21 so we will write this 21 in second place of the resultant term.

                </p>
                <div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-left: 50px;">
                    <img src="image4.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    and now we simply has the result.
                </p>
                <div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-left: 50px;">
                    <img src="image5.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    this is the simple way to add fractions.
